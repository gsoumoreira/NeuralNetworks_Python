# Logistic Regression using python

In this repository, we will use data from Coursera's course Machine Learning (Professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University), as well as follow the development steps of code and theory proposed by the course itself. However, python will be the programming language used, with the purpose of exercising the development of logistic regression in another language, as well as discussing other possible paths that python libraries provide.

Please check the print version of the [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gsoumoreira/LogisticRegression_Python/blob/master/LogisticRegression.ipynb) and for code details, access the jupyter notebook directly.
